# Platformed
One day I wanted to make a ASCII game. I looked it up, thinking that someone had made it before. But no one had (in JS), at least that I could find! So I decided to try it.
Platformed is a platformer game rendered entirely in ASCII characters (vanilla js and one &lt;pre> element). Not only that, but it is the most compatible game I have ever tried to run (it runs at ~1fps on my kindle), without any external browser dependencies.
